### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 was my favorite because it was essentially the beginning of how to code, and when we finally were able to make the code work, it felt accomplished seeing the “Hello World” pop up. What I learned is that to code, it takes understanding and patience because when we were completing it, the lab took us almost two hours to complete. 

* Lab 6

   Lab 6, part 2 was another one I think that I liked. I liked it for the reason that it had blackjack involved. I never played or understood it so attempting to code the values that would ensure the right hand was an interesting process. What I learned from that lab is that you can code almost anything, even simple card games and even those can be a bit complicated. 


* Lab 10

   Lab 10, specifically part 2, was probably the hardest for me, which is why it's my third favorite as well. As much as I had trouble with it, I had help from a tutor and when I started to understand it, it came easier, which is why it became my third favorite. Learning about the densest state and the population density in each state was fun to me. I learned that when it comes to trying to figure out values like these, they seemed to include a lot of less or greater than.
